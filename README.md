# EMV-Chipset-Encoding-LStacks-GStacks-Binaries
This documentation is produced by: FreshStuff88 (Telegram: @Fresh_stuff88) the CEO of SwipeKingsOfficialâ„¢ (Telegram Channel: t.me/swipekingsofficial), &amp; Virgilwulf (Telegram: @VIRGILWULF).  We built this data format off of a linux framework as built from OEM card manufacturers.  It is utilized to encode EMV stacks, within full capabilities, (not using magstripe data as a catalyst)

"LStacks", "GStacks" & "Binaries", are a vertically intergrated chipset formula that manufactuers utilize to encode the EMV Chip, it works in syncrocy with the
magstripe to facilitate payments.  When we acquire EMV specific data, the encoding proccess must start here, and then finish at magstripe.  This is the same 
scripting that we utilize within a robust manner accross all of our softwares.  

This is essnetially the "BASIS" all of our softwares are simply alternatives of this, with enchanced functionality and use-cases. 

What can I do with this scripting? 

This is simply for encoding EMV datastacks that have been acquired from skimmers on to "Cloned Cards", within a linux enviorment. 

By Who? 

This is by Freshstuff88 (Telegram: @Fresh_Stuff88) & Virgilwulf (Telegram: @VIRGILWULF).  We are the CEO & CTO of SwipeKingsOfficial, our store specilizes
in physical carding. 

Who is this for? 

We created this as a "Base" it essentially runs as our full stack framework that powers almost all of our applications.  This is needed both as a refrence for
all developers making modifications or presets for our softwares.  But also for clients that are within our P2P Skimming Infrastructure, that will need this
to make more specicialized versions of our softwares for closed source purposes.
